# DEEP (Decentralised Ecological Economics Protocol)

## Overview

At Sovereign Nature Initiative, our goal is to reconfigure the economics of ecology by finding ways to fund and expand projects that sustain life on our planet. Currently, most ecological stewarding projects are severely underfunded. Biodiversity restoration primarily relies on donations, and funding from philanthropists, public institutions, and other donors. The lack of sustainable financial streams is estimated at approximately $700 billion per year according to the Convention on Biological Diversity Secretariat. Private voluntary contributions toward nature-positive efforts, also known as “private investments in nature”, play a key role in addressing this funding gap.

We developed the Decentralised Ecological Economics Protocol (DEEP) together with the Registry for Ecological Asset Linking (REAL) to ensure that private committments are valuable, and eventually a key mode for contributing to the restoration of biodiversity worldwide. Our protocol and interface allow us to effectively integrate data about ecological impact with the digital realm. This approach generates new funding streams while imbuing digital assets with tangible and real-life significance. Critically, our approach allows ecological stewards to market their work without impeding their on-site efforts, ensuring a harmonious balance between financial viability and biodiversity restoration.

Our work is guided by the following key propositions:

- breaking with the paradigm of donation: the value of biodiversity is integrated into digital products increasing their value in the digital economy by imbuing them with meaning in the age of digital overproduction;
  verifying impact through data: minimal access to the most relevant ecological field data used by organisations to monitor their progress and evaluate impact, with a digestible explanation of how the data is used to inform nature-positive strategies and actions;
- selecting trustworthy partners: investing in projects of ecological stewards with a long and successful track record that operate on the ground and are guided by a holistic vision of sustaining life on earth for all species;
- reducing the distance: developing meaningful and long-term connections between contributors and biodiversity practitioners lays the foundation for a large-scale socio-economic transformation;

## What Is DEEP

DEEP is a protocol that brings eco-data to digital creatives. We collaborate with ecological stewards, such as conservation organisations and rewilding projects, who already generate data as part of their daily work.

Eco-data spans species-specific insights obtained through direct observations, evidence of species’ presence (e.g., droppings, tracks), and GPS-tracking devices, as well as broader habitat or ecosystem data collected via top-down remote sensing technologies such as satellites or ground collection of soil and plant samples.

We process this data and make it accessible to digital creatives through our protocol, moving it through cleaning, standardisation, and aggregation data pipelines.

Digital creatives utilize this data in their projects, which can range from gaming and virtual environments to music production. The digital representations created using this data are then made available for purchase, with a share of the proceeds (50-70%) going to the conservation organisations directly, and a share to Sovereign Nature Initiative to fund its continued operation.

## DEEP Concepts

Most of the protocol concepts are explained in a separate [protocol section](deep.md).
