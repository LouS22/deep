# Registry for Ecological Assets Linking (REAL)

## Overview

REAL, is a platform that functions as a registry for nature-positive claims, connecting contributions to ecological field data through Eco-Linked Assets. Utilising dAPP functionalities, the REAL aim is to democratise public participation in nature-positive efforts.

Each Eco-linked Asset hosted on REAL integrates comprehensive qualitative and quantitative data about a Supported Project, the Ecological Stewards running it and its Objective and metrics used to track progress.

## Ecological Contributions in REAL

To structure the type of information and reporting needed for each Eco-linked Asset in a way that sufficiently informs an Ecological Contributor about the impact of their Ecological Contribution, Sovereign Nature Initiative has developed the EIPRV Methodology. This methodology, embedded in the REAL user experience, is an adaptation of globally applied best practices for international conservation project management, reporting, and verification to offer an engaging, transparent, and comprehensive perspective on the intentions, progress status and verifiable additionality of an Ecological Contribution on the Ecological Entity.

REAL is hence designed to transform how both individuals and conservation/restoration project developers mutually participate, report, and verify their respective financial contributions and ecological efforts offering a user-friendly interface that fosters educational and participatory experiences.

With REAL, SNI aims to enhance trust and commitment between funders and stewards of nature-positive initiatives, highlighting the potential of alternative funding sources and public involvement in supporting the ambitious targets the world has set to support significant conservation and restoration efforts globally.

## REAL Glossary

### Eco-Linked Asset

The digital proof accessible through REAL issued to individuals as the result of their allocation of an Ecological Contribution toward a Supported Project, containing relevant information about the Ecological Steward, the Supported Project, its Objectives, and relevant impact verification content such as Eco-Data and the Steward Feed.

### Ecological Entity

A defined component of nature that is the target of the Ecological Steward conservation and/or restoration efforts. This term may include specific species populations, entire habitats or ecosystems, or defined protected areas that support diverse species and animal communities within their boundaries.

### Ecological Steward

An identified group of individuals responsible for the conservation, protection, and/or restoration of an identified ecology (referred to as Ecological Entity). This group may take the form of a non-governmental institution, project developers, a governmental agency, a local community, a collaborative team of researchers, or any other human assemblage managing the allocation of funds and operations needed to conserve and/or restore an identified Ecological Entity.

### Stewardship Area

The specific geographical region where the Ecological Entity is situated and where the Ecological Steward operates.

### Linked Ecology

The part of the Ecological Entity to which the Eco-Data refers and that is used to link the Ecological Contribution to the specific Supported Project.

### Threats

Anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic drivers that directly or indirectly degrade or in other ways negatively influence the survival of the Ecological Entity.

### Ecological Contribution

A voluntary monetary disbursement linked to Eco-Data about an Ecological Entity aimed to support a Supported Project from an Ecological Steward working on the conservation or restoration of the identified Ecological Entity.

### Supported Project

Particular project of the Ecological Steward to which funds have been specifically allocated as a result of fundraising efforts.
Project Objective(s): a statement identifying the measurable, relevant, achievable, and time-bound outcome(s) expected from the strategies and activities implemented by the Supported Project.

### Progress Metrics

The metric or indicator used by the Ecological Steward to monitor and report on the progress toward the identified Project Objective.
Eco-Data: Data and metadata that is linked to a specific Ecological Contribution and accessible through an issued Eco-linked Asset. The Eco-Data requirements are that it needs to be relevant, educational, and rich in empathy, it needs to be collected by the Ecological Steward and shall refer to the Ecological Entity the Project Supported is intended to conserve and/or restore. The Eco-Data is utilized both internally to inform their conservation and/or restoration strategies and actions, and externally to report on their nature-positive impact.

### Steward Feed(s)

The ecological impact reporting and verification tool embedded in an Eco-linked Asset to display a stream of rich content collected by an Ecological Steward to report on the progress of the Supported Project updates such as events of progress toward the Project Objective.
